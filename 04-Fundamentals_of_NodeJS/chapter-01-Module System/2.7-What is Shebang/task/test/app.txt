-------------- Shebang --------------
 
In order to execute/run a bash script file with the bash shell interpreter, the first line of a script file must indicate the absolute path to the bash executable:

#!/bin/bash
This is also called a Shebang.

All that the shebang does is to instruct the operating system to run the script with the /bin/bash executable.

However, bash is not always in /bin/bash directory, particularly on non-Linux systems or due to installation as an optional package. Thus, you may want to use:

#!/usr/bin/env bash
It searches for bash executable in directories, listed in PATH environmental variable.
