✳️ Character Set vs Character Encoding
📘 Character Set
A Character Set is a collection of characters and the codes assigned to represent them.
It defines which characters exist — letters, digits, symbols, control characters, etc.
✅ Popular Character Sets:
ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange):
Supports 128 characters
Uses 7 bits to represent characters → 2⁷ = 128
Includes: A–Z, a–z, 0–9, punctuation, and control characters
Unicode:
A much larger set capable of representing over 1.1 million characters
Supports characters from all major languages, emojis, symbols, etc.
🧠 Character Encoding
Character Encoding defines how characters from the set are represented as binary data (0s and 1s).
It is the actual implementation that translates characters into bytes.
🧾 Examples:
ASCII Encoding:
Uses 7 bits per character
Encodes only ASCII character set
UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format - 8 bit):
Variable-length encoding (1 to 4 bytes)
Backward-compatible with ASCII (first 128 characters are same)
Most popular Unicode encoding today (used in HTML, web, etc.)
